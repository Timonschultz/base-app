## Base App

#### Introduction:
This repository holds several branches that provide base examples. Included will be a simple
Spring Boot app. The examples will utilise several techniques and library like Docker, Angular
Postgress etc.   

The repository will house several branches, each consisting of their own extetion on this base 
App from the Master branch.

#### Base app:

The base app is a simple Spring Boot web app that supports two operations.
 
1) GET operation on localhost:8080/base returns a JSON model.   

        {
            "name": "foo",
            "message": "This is a model generated by the backend service"
        }

   Name and message are predefined in the code.

2) POST operation on localhost:8080/base returns a JSON model. 
 
        {
            "name": "String",
            "message": "String"
        }

   A JSON model is returned base on the model provided to the API in the POST call.


#### Example implementations:

Below is a list of examples already created. Note, this will be a Work in Progress project.
